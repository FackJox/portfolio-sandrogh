# Contact Section Testing Documentation

## Overview
The Contact section tests are designed to validate both the current static content and the anticipated form functionality. The tests ensure that the section renders correctly, displays appropriate contact information, and will support full form validation and submission when implemented.

## Component Structure
- **Contact Section**: Main container for all contact-related content
- **Contact Information**: Email and social media information
- **CTA Button**: Call-to-action for booking a consultation
- **Contact Form**: Form for users to send messages (not yet implemented)

## Testing Approach
The Contact section tests are divided into several categories to comprehensively test both existing functionality and planned features:

1. **Rendering Tests**: Verify that the section renders correctly with all expected elements
2. **Form Submission Tests**: Placeholder tests for when form submission functionality is implemented
3. **Validation Tests**: Placeholder tests for form field validation
4. **State Management Tests**: Tests for loading, success, and error states
5. **Field Interaction Tests**: Tests for real-time validation and user interactions
6. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify that the section meets accessibility standards
7. **Responsive Layout Tests**: Ensure that the section adapts to different screen sizes

## Key Test Cases

### Rendering Tests
- Renders the contact section with correct heading
- Displays contact information correctly (email, social media)
- Renders the call-to-action button
- Will render contact form with required fields (placeholder test)

### Form Submission Tests (Placeholders)
- Will submit form data when valid
- Will handle API errors gracefully

### Validation Tests (Placeholders)
- Will validate required fields
- Will validate email format

### State Management Tests (Placeholders)
- Will display loading state during submission
- Will display success message after successful submission
- Will display error message after failed submission

### Field Interaction Tests (Placeholders)
- Will validate fields in real-time as user types
- Will trim input values before validation

### Accessibility Tests
- Has no accessibility violations
- Will provide accessible error messages (placeholder test)

### Responsive Layout Tests
- Uses appropriate responsive classes

## Mock API Integration
The tests use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to simulate API responses for form submission, allowing testing of:

1. Successful form submissions
2. Validation errors
3. Server errors

## Example Test Cases

```tsx
// Basic rendering test
it("renders the contact section with correct heading", () => {
  render(<Contact />)
  expect(screen.getByText("LET'S CONNECT")).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// Form submission test (placeholder)
it("should submit form data when valid", async () => {
  render(<Contact />)
  // Mock form submission with userEvent
  // Test successful submission feedback
})

// Accessibility test
it("should have no accessibility violations", async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Contact />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

## Implementation Notes

### Current Tests
Tests that verify the existing functionality:
- Section rendering
- Contact information display
- CTA button presence
- Accessibility compliance
- Responsive layout

### Placeholder Tests
Tests that are prepared for future implementations:
- Form rendering
- Form validation
- Form submission
- Error handling
- Success feedback
- Real-time validation

These placeholder tests are commented out in the test file and will be enabled once the form functionality is implemented.

## Future Enhancements
When the Contact form is implemented, the following enhancements to the tests should be made:

1. Enable commented-out form-related tests
2. Add tests for any custom validation logic
3. Test integration with any notification systems
4. Test form reset functionality
5. Test successful form submission's UI feedback

## Test Dependencies
- **Testing Library**: For rendering components and simulating user interactions
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **Mock Service Worker**: For mocking API requests
- **jest-axe**: For testing accessibility compliance
