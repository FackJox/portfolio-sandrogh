# End-to-End Testing

This document serves as a placeholder for future end-to-end (E2E) testing documentation for the Sandro Portfolio project. While E2E testing is not yet implemented, this document outlines the planned approach and considerations for future implementation.

## Overview

End-to-end testing verifies that the entire application works together as expected from the user's perspective. These tests simulate real user scenarios and test complete user flows from start to finish.

## Planned E2E Testing Approach

### Testing Framework

The Sandro Portfolio project plans to use one of the following E2E testing frameworks:

- **Cypress**: A JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework designed for modern web applications
- **Playwright**: A framework for web testing and automation that allows testing across all modern browsers

### Key User Flows to Test

Future E2E tests will focus on these critical user journeys:

1. **Navigation Flow**: Testing that users can navigate through all main sections of the portfolio
2. **Contact Form Submission**: Testing the complete contact form submission process
3. **Project Filtering and Viewing**: Testing project filtering, sorting, and detailed view
4. **Responsive Design**: Testing the application across different device sizes
5. **Accessibility Journey**: Testing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Test Structure

E2E tests will be organized by user flow and will follow a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// Example future Cypress test structure
describe('Navigation Flow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('/');
  });
  
  it('allows users to navigate to all main sections', () => {
    // Test navigation to About section
    cy.get('nav').contains('About').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '#about');
    cy.get('#about').should('be.visible');
    
    // Test navigation to Projects section
    cy.get('nav').contains('Projects').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '#projects');
    cy.get('#projects').should('be.visible');
    
    // Continue for all main sections
  });
});
```

### Test Environment

E2E tests will run in a dedicated test environment that closely mirrors the production environment:

- Using realistic data fixtures
- Testing against a production-like build
- Potentially using mock services for external dependencies

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation of E2E testing is planned for the following phases:

1. **Setup Phase** (Future)
   - Set up the chosen E2E testing framework
   - Configure test environment
   - Create initial test structure

2. **Initial Implementation** (Future)
   - Implement tests for critical user flows
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
   - Establish baseline performance metrics

3. **Expanded Coverage** (Future)
   - Add tests for edge cases and error handling
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Enhance performance and accessibility testing

## Best Practices (Planned)

When implementing E2E tests, the project will follow these best practices:

1. **Focus on user flows** rather than implementation details
2. **Use stable selectors** that won't break with UI changes (data-testid, roles, etc.)
3. **Keep tests independent** from one another
4. **Test across different browsers** and viewport sizes
5. **Avoid flaky tests** by using proper waiting mechanisms and retry strategies
6. **Use realistic data** that represents real-world usage

## Integration with CI/CD (Planned)

E2E tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

- Running on pull requests to detect regressions
- Running on deployment to staging environments
- Potentially running a subset of critical tests on production deployments

## Future Resources

Once E2E testing is implemented, this section will be updated with:

- Documentation for the chosen testing framework
- Guidelines for writing effective E2E tests
- Common patterns and solutions for testing challenges
- Performance benchmarks and targets

## Initial Setup Checklist (Future)

- [ ] Select E2E testing framework
- [ ] Add dependencies and configuration
- [ ] Set up basic test structure
- [ ] Create test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Implement first test for critical user flow
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document approach and patterns
