# Test Coverage Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the test coverage progress for the Sandro Portfolio project, helping identify areas that need improvement to meet coverage thresholds.

## Current Coverage Status (Updated: Latest Test Run)

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Statements | 5.25% | 20% | ❌ Not Meeting Target |
| Branches | 7.16% | 15% | ❌ Not Meeting Target |
| Functions | 3.20% | 20% | ❌ Not Meeting Target |
| Lines | 5.14% | 20% | ❌ Not Meeting Target |

## Coverage Distribution

### Well-Covered Components (≥90%)

| Component | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| lib/utils.ts | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| components/ui/form/button.tsx | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| components/ui/form/checkbox.tsx | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| components/ui/form/input.tsx | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| components/ui/form/input-otp.tsx | 96.29% | 95.45% | 100% | 95.83% |
| components/ui/theming/theme-provider.tsx | 100% | 0% | 100% | 100% |

### Priority Areas For Improvement

#### High Priority (0% Coverage)

* `app/` directory:
  * layout.tsx
  * page.tsx
  
* `components/sections/`:
  * About.tsx
  * Contact.tsx
  * Hero.tsx
  * InstagramFeed.tsx
  * MediaCategories.tsx
  * Testimonials.tsx
  * featured-work-carousel.tsx
  
* `hooks/`:
  * use-mobile.tsx
  * use-scroll-carousel.tsx
  * use-toast.ts

#### Medium Priority (Low Coverage)

* `components/ui/overlay/` - 3.15% statement coverage
* `components/ui/form/` - Good coverage for some components, but 0% for many others

## Test Coverage Gap Analysis

Based on the current coverage report, the following gaps have been identified:

1. **Section Components**: 0% coverage across all section components. These components make up a significant portion of the application's UI and business logic.

2. **Hooks**: 0% coverage for all custom hooks. Hooks contain critical business logic and should be thoroughly tested.

3. **App Components**: 0% coverage for layout and page components. These components define the overall structure of the application.

4. **UI Components**: Highly variable coverage, with some components (button, checkbox, input, input-otp) at 95-100% and others at 0%.

## Action Plan

1. Begin with testing high-priority components first
2. Focus on components with the greatest impact on overall coverage
3. Establish test patterns for each component type
4. Add tests incrementally until coverage thresholds are met

## Coverage History

| Date | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Latest | 5.25% | 7.16% | 3.20% | 5.14% | Added comprehensive tests for Input component |
| Previous | 4.82% | 7.16% | 2.56% | 4.69% | Initial measurement after setting new thresholds |

## Notes

* Coverage thresholds have been set to encourage gradual improvement
* Focus on meaningful tests that verify behavior, not just increasing coverage numbers
* Component tests should include variants, behavior, accessibility, and edge cases
