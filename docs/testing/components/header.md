# Header Component Testing

This document outlines the testing approach and implementation for the Header component in the Sandro Portfolio project.

## Component Overview

The Header component is a key layout component that provides site navigation. It includes:

- Logo/brand link
- Desktop navigation menu
- Mobile responsive navigation with a slide-out drawer
- Call-to-action button

## Test Coverage

The Header component tests achieve comprehensive coverage of both structure and behavior:

- **Basic rendering**: Validates all expected elements are present
- **Navigation links**: Verifies correct links and href attributes
- **Logo rendering**: Tests the brand link functionality
- **Mobile navigation**: Tests the mobile menu content through mocked Sheet component
- **Styling and positioning**: Verifies correct layout classes
- **Hover effects**: Tests the presence of hover style classes
- **Accessibility**: Validates accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive behavior**: Tests responsive display logic for mobile/desktop views

## Test Implementation

The tests are implemented in `components/layout/Header.test.tsx` and use React Testing Library with Jest. 

### Test Structure

```tsx
describe('Header', () => {
  // Basic rendering tests
  it('renders correctly with all expected elements', () => {...});

  // Navigation link tests
  it('contains all expected navigation links with correct href attributes', () => {...});
  
  // Logo tests
  it('renders the logo with correct styling and link', () => {...});

  // Mobile navigation tests
  it('includes mobile navigation with correct content', () => {...});

  // Styling tests
  it('has the correct positioning and styling', () => {...});
  it('has proper hover styles for navigation links', () => {...});

  // Accessibility tests
  it('has proper accessibility attributes', () => {...});

  // Responsive behavior tests
  it('properly hides/shows elements based on screen size', () => {...});
});
```

### Special Testing Considerations

1. **Next.js Link Component**: The tests mock the Next.js Link component to simplify testing.

2. **Radix UI Sheet Component**: The tests mock the Sheet component to avoid issues with dialog behavior and to test the mobile navigation content directly.

3. **Handling Multiple Elements with Same Role**: The tests use the `within` API to target specific elements when there are multiple elements with the same role (like navigation elements and links).

4. **Mobile Navigation Testing**: Instead of simulating clicks to open the mobile menu, the tests directly verify the presence and content of the mocked Sheet component.

5. **Accessibility Testing**: Validates screen reader text via `.sr-only` elements and checks that navigation is keyboard accessible.

6. **Responsive Testing**: Checks that components have the appropriate responsive utility classes (e.g., `md:flex`, `md:hidden`).

## Test Results

The Header component tests verify:

- Correct rendering of all UI elements
- Proper navigation link functionality
- Mobile menu structure and content
- Accessibility compliance
- Visual styling through Tailwind classes

The component achieved 100% test coverage across all metrics:
- Statements: 100%
- Branches: 100%
- Functions: 100%
- Lines: 100%

These tests help ensure the Header component maintains its functionality and appearance as the application evolves.
