# Detailed Test Coverage Implementation Blueprint


## Overview of the Implementation Strategy

This blueprint breaks down the test coverage plan into granular, executable steps that build progressively toward the target coverage thresholds. The approach prioritizes establishing reusable patterns and infrastructure first, then systematically covering components based on complexity and impact.

### Phase 0: Testing Infrastructure and Foundations

```markdown
## Prompt 1: Set up Testing Utilities and Helpers
```
```
Create robust testing utilities that will support all subsequent component tests. Begin by enhancing the existing test-utils.tsx with additional helper functions for:
1. A custom render function that includes necessary providers
2. Utilities for testing Radix UI components specifically
3. Form testing helpers for controlled/uncontrolled components
4. Tailwind class assertion helpers
5. Mock data generators for common test scenarios

Ensure all utilities are well-documented with JSDoc comments and include basic unit tests for the utilities themselves. This foundation will accelerate all subsequent testing work.
```

```markdown
## Prompt 2: Create Component Test Template
```
```
Develop a standardized test template that we'll use for all component tests. This template should include sections for:
1. Basic rendering tests
2. Prop variations tests
3. Event handling tests
4. Accessibility tests using jest-axe
5. Integration tests with parent/child components

The template should demonstrate best practices for React Testing Library usage, focusing on user-centric queries and behavior testing rather than implementation details. Include detailed comments explaining the rationale behind each test pattern.
```

### Phase 1: Form Components (Simple to Complex)

```markdown
## Prompt 3: Input Component Tests
```
```
Looking at the codebase, input.tsx appears to be the simplest form component. Building on our testing utilities and template, implement comprehensive tests for the Input component:
1. Test rendering with default props
2. Test all input variants (outline, filled, etc.)
3. Test controlled vs uncontrolled behavior
4. Test input validation and error states
5. Test accessibility (label association, error announcements)
6. Test event handlers (onChange, onFocus, onBlur)
7. Test integration with form context if applicable

Use this as an opportunity to refine our testing patterns before moving to more complex components.
```

```markdown
## Prompt 4: Textarea Component Tests
```
```
Expand on the existing textarea.tsx tests to ensure complete coverage. Implement tests for:
1. Test rendering with default props and various configurations
2. Test controlled vs uncontrolled value updates
3. Test resizing behavior if applicable
4. Test accessibility attributes and focus management
5. Test form integration including validation states
6. Test character counting or limitations if implemented
7. Test placeholder behavior in different states

This should build on patterns established in the Input component tests while addressing textarea-specific behaviors.
```

```markdown
## Prompt 5: Checkbox Component Tests
```
```
Implement comprehensive tests for the Checkbox component, addressing its unique interaction patterns:
1. Test rendering in checked, unchecked, and indeterminate states

4. Test error message display and association
5. Test form reset functionality
6. Test dynamic field addition/removal if applicable
