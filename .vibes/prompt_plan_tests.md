## Decomposed Implementation Steps With LLM Prompts

### Phase 1: Foundation & Utilities

#### Step 1.1: Enhance Jest Configuration

```
Update the jest.config.js file to improve the testing setup. Specifically:
1. Keep the current configuration but update the coverageThreshold to start with small targets (10% for statements, functions, lines)
2. Add moduleDirectories to include node_modules
3. Add verbose: true for more detailed test output
4. Add testMatch to ensure consistent test file discovery
5. Keep collectCoverage: true

The goal is to establish a minimal but enforceable baseline for test coverage without being too restrictive at the start.
```

#### Step 1.2: Create Basic Test Utilities

```
Create a comprehensive test-utils.tsx file in the __tests__/utils directory with the following utilities:

1. Enhanced render function that includes common providers (if any)
2. Custom matchers for Tailwind CSS classes:
   - hasClasses: Checks if element has all specified classes
   - hasAnyClass: Checks if element has any of the specified classes
   - compareClasses: Compares rendered classes with expected classes
3. Helper for testing Radix UI components with proper context
4. Mock functions for common operations (e.g., navigation, window resize)

Export all utilities and ensure they're properly typed with TypeScript.
```

#### Step 1.3: Test CN Utility Function

This threshold increase reinforces the importance of test coverage as the project matures.
```

### Phase 4: End-to-End Tests

#### Step 4.1: Set Up Cypress for E2E Testing

```
Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing:

1. Install Cypress and required dependencies
2. Create a basic cypress.config.js configuration
3. Set up a directory structure for E2E tests
4. Create helper utilities for common operations
5. Set up commands for starting the application and running tests
6. Configure Cypress for TypeScript support
7. Add Cypress to package.json scripts

The goal is to establish the foundational infrastructure for E2E testing.
```

#### Step 4.2: Create Basic Smoke Test

```
Create a basic smoke test in Cypress to verify critical application functionality:

1. Test that the application loads correctly
2. Test that the header is displayed with navigation
3. Test that all main sections are visible
4. Test that images load properly
5. Test that basic interactions work (clicking navigation items)
6. Test that the footer is displayed with expected content
7. Test basic accessibility compliance using cypress-axe

This test should verify that the application's core functionality works properly.
```

#### Step 4.3: Create Critical User Flow Tests

```
Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows:

1. Test navigation from header to each section
2. Test form submission in the Contact section
3. Test media interaction in the portfolio/gallery sections
4. Test any filtering or sorting functionality
5. Test responsive behavior at different viewport sizes
6. Test loading states and transitions
7. Test error handling for common error scenarios

These tests should verify that key user journeys work correctly from start to finish.
```

6. Include guide for test-driven development workflow
7. Document coverage expectations and monitoring approach

This provides a complete reference for the project's testing approach.
```

#### Step 5.5: Create Testing Metrics Dashboard

```
Create a testing metrics dashboard or reporting mechanism:

1. Configure a tool to generate testing reports (Jest HTML reporter or similar)
2. Set up tracking for coverage trends over time
3. Create visualization for test results and coverage
4. Set up alerting for coverage regressions
5. Document how to interpret and use the testing reports
6. Configure the dashboard to be generated on CI runs
7. Add links to the reports in the project documentation

This provides visibility into the health of the test suite over time.
```

## Summary

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building a comprehensive testing strategy for the Sandro Portfolio project. The plan is designed to be implemented incrementally, with each phase building upon the previous one, and with gradual increases in test coverage thresholds to ensure steady progress.

Each step includes a specific prompt that can be used with a code-generation LLM to implement that part of the strategy. The prompts are structured to provide clear guidance while allowing for adaptation to the specific needs of the project.
